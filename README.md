This README is for a Rock Paper Scissors game which is part of the first Javascript project in The Odin Project!

This will be re-used in a later project where we will input a UI.  As of now this will only be played in the console.

To play:
    * Make a copy of this repo
    * Open index.html file in preferred browser
    * Use the prompt box to enter your choice between rock, paper or scissors
    * Open console in dev tools to see who won that round and who wins best of 5
